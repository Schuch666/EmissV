This package provides some methods to create emissions (with a focus on vehicular emissions) for use in numeric air quality models such as [WRF-Chem](https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/).

## Installation

### System dependencies 

EmissV import functions from [ncdf4](http://cran.r-project.org/package=ncdf4) for reading model information, [raster](http://cran.r-project.org/package=raster) and [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) to process grinded/geographic information and [units](https://github.com/edzer/units/).

## Using `EmissV`

In EmissV the vehicular emissions are estimated by a top-down approach, i.e. the emissions are calculated using the statistical description of the fleet at avaliable level (National, Estadual, City, etc).The following steps show an example workflow for calculating vehicular emissions, these emissions are initially temporally and spatially disaggregated, and then distributed spatially and temporally.

**I.** Total: emission of pollutants is estimated from the fleet, use and emission factors and for the interest area (cities, states, countries, etc).

``` r
library(EmissV)

fleet <- vehicles(example = T)
# using a example of vehicles (DETRAN 2016 data and SP vahicle distribution):
#                              Category   Type Fuel      Use       SP ...
# Light Duty Vehicles Gasohol   LDV_E25    LDV  E25  41 km/d 11624342 ...
# Light Duty Vehicles Ethanol  LDV_E100    LDV E100  41 km/d   874627 ...
# Light Duty Vehicles Flex        LDV_F    LDV FLEX  41 km/d  9845022 ...
# Diesel Trucks               TRUCKS_B5 TRUCKS   B5 110 km/d   710634 ...
# Diesel Urban Busses           CBUS_B5    BUS   B5 165 km/d   792630 ...
# Diesel Intercity Busses       MBUS_B5    BUS   B5 165 km/d    21865 ...
# Gasohol Motorcycles          MOTO_E25   MOTO  E25 140 km/d  3227921 ...
# Flex Motorcycles               MOTO_F   MOTO FLEX 140 km/d   235056 ...

fleet <- fleet[,c(-6,-8,-9)] # dropping RJ, PR and SC

EF     <- emissionFactor(example = T)
# using a example emission factor (values calculated from CETESB 2015):
#                                     CO          PM
# Light duty Vehicles Gasohol  1.75 g/km 0.0013 g/km
# Light Duty Vehicles Ethanol 10.04 g/km 0.0000 g/km
# Light Duty Vehicles Flex     0.39 g/km 0.0010 g/km
# Diesel trucks                0.45 g/km 0.0612 g/km
# Diesel urban busses          0.77 g/km 0.1052 g/km
# Diesel intercity busses      1.48 g/km 0.1693 g/km
# Gasohol motorcycles          1.61 g/km 0.0000 g/km
# Flex motorcycles             0.75 g/km 0.0000 g/km

TOTAL  <- totalEmission(fleet,EF,pol = c("CO"),verbose = T)
# Total of CO : 1128297.0993334 t year-1
```

**II.** Spatial distribution: The package has functions to read information from tables, georeferenced images (tiff), shapefiles (sh), OpenStreet maps (osm), global inventories in NetCDF format (nc) to calculate point, line and area sources.

``` r
raster <- raster::raster(paste(system.file("extdata", package = "EmissV"),
                         "/dmsp.tiff",sep=""))

grid   <- gridInfo(paste(system.file("extdata", package = "EmissV"),
                   "/wrfinput_d02",sep=""))
# Grid information from: .../EmissV/extdata/wrfinput_d02

shape  <- raster::shapefile(paste(system.file("extdata", package = "EmissV"),
                            "/BR.shp",sep=""),verbose = F)[12,1]
Minas_Gerais <- areaSource(shape,raster,grid,name = "Minas Gerais")
# processing Minas Gerais area ...
# fraction of Minas Gerais area inside the domain = 0.0145921494236101

shape  <- raster::shapefile(paste(system.file("extdata", package = "EmissV"),
                            "/BR.shp",sep=""),verbose = F)[22,1]
Sao_Paulo <- areaSource(shape,raster,grid,name = "Sao Paulo")
# processing Sao Paulo area ...
# fraction of Sao Paulo area inside the domain = 0.474658563750987

sp::spplot(raster::merge(drop_units(TOTAL$CO[[1]]) * Sao_Paulo, 
                         drop_units(TOTAL$CO[[2]]) * Minas_Gerais),
           scales = list(draw=TRUE),ylab="Lat",xlab="Lon",
           main=list(label="Emissions of CO [g/d]"),
           col.regions = c("#031638","#001E48","#002756","#003062",
                           "#003A6E","#004579","#005084","#005C8E",
                           "#006897","#0074A1","#0081AA","#008FB3",
                           "#009EBD","#00AFC8","#00C2D6","#00E3F0"))
```

**III.** Emission calculation: calculate the final emission from all different sources and converts to model units and resolution.
``` r
CO_emissions <- emission(TOTAL,"CO",list(SP = Sao_Paulo, MG = Minas_Gerais),grid,mm=28, plot = T)
# calculating emissions for CO using molar mass = 28 ...
```

**IV.** Temporal distribution: the package has a set of hourly profiles that represent the mean activity for each day of the week calculated from traffic counts of toll stations located in SÃ£o Paulo city.
``` r
data(perfil)
names(perfil)
```

The package has additional functions for read netcdf data, create line and point sources (with plume rise) and to estimate the total emissions of of volatile organic compounds from exhaust (through the exhaust pipe), liquid (carter and evaporative) and  vapor (fuel transfer operations).
