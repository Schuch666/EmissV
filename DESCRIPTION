Description: Processing tools to create emissions for use in numerical air 
  quality models. Emissions can be calculated both using emission factors 
  and activity data or using pollutant inventories. Functions to process 
  individual point emissions, line emissions and area emissions of pollutants 
  are available as well as methods to incorporate alternative data for Spatial 
  distribution of emissions such as openstreetmap data or satellite images.
